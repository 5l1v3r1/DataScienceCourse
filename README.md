This is the repo supporting Intro to Data Science (DS-GA-1001) for the NYU Center for Data Science. For homework assignments, quizzes, exams and course grades, please log in to NYU Classes.

This repo contains reference iPython notebooks and Labs. It is recommended to fork this repo so that it move to your own Github account. These notebooks are updated on a regular basis, so it is advisable to pull with each use. However, you'll want to work out a system to make sure you don't accidentally overwrite any edits you've made when pulling. One example is to copy each file and add a '_YourName' extention to it, leaving the original untouched. I generally do not accept pull requests, but will consider if you present a compelling case.  

The course syllabus can be found here.
